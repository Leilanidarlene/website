# Rabbit Ear Mountain

Rabbit Ear mountain was an important landmark on the Santa Fe Trail because it not only was a visible landmark from all directions, while also providing a reliable source of drinkable water for 30 miles, it also provided a [flatter and faster route](https://offtheroadnm.org/details.php?id=201) than the Raton Pass. After passing the desolate desert before reaching Rabbit Ear, water and edible greenery was sparse for travelers. Once a traveler would reach the Mountain, they would typically meander through the area for four days, enjoying the natural resources. These groups of men, women, and children would cross the valleys of the mountain and emerge from the landscape replenish and rejuvenated. Once they left this safe haven, the next closet town that provided travelers with necessities was Clayton New Mexico located to the north of the Mountain [^NationalRegisterForm].

### How it got its name

Rabbit Ear Mountain was named “Rabbit Ear” after the great [Cheyenne Chief Orejo de Conejos](https://www.legendsofamerica.com/nm-cimarronroute/), whose name translates to ‘Rabbits Ear’. He was given this name due to his supposed damaged ear caused by frostbite when he was a child. According to the popular story told by the early Spanish settlers, this Chief was killed in a bloody battle with the Spanish Army in 1717. After the battel, Orejo de Conejos was buried on top of the larger of the two volcanic hills, and therefore named after him to memorialize his bravery against the Spanish. 

### The Battle

The story of [the battle of Rabbit Ear Mountain](https://www.claytonnm.org/rabbitearmountain) is told in the perspective of the Spanish-American settlers, taking place in 1717. In this legendary story, the battle started after some Comanche Indians were holding several Spanish hostage. As a result, an expedition of about 500 soldiers was sent from Santa Fe to attempt to free these prisoners from their bondage. The expedition was well armed and equipped as they moved out toward Rabbit Ear after learning that they were camped out there. Once the Spanish forces arrived, they decided to charge the camp at daylight. This battle killed hundreds, both Spanish and Comanche, and the Spanish was said to have taken 700 Comanches prisoner. The Spanish were successful in freeing the captives. It is also rumored that the Comanche never again went on the warpath against the Spaniards and a treaty was made to cease the fighting between the two groups [^NationalParkService].

### Terrain

These iconic mountains are remnants of volcanoes and apart of the larger Raton-Clayton Volcanic Field. This changes the terrain and landscape depending on where on the mountains you are located. There are some areas where the ground is firm, loose, or sandy, as well as ranging from flat plains to ridges and valleys. The Spring is where the water is the most plentiful, where travelers would camp out near for convenience. The best time of year for men and women traveling the Santa Fe Tail to pass though would be the Spring, when the winter snow has melted and the heat is not yet overwhelming. It has several large grassy fields and areas for animals to graze upon as travelers make their camp for the night, making it a safe haven on their rough adventure. The twin peaks are 6,062 ft and differ in name due to size differences. The larger mountain is called ["Rabbit Ear Mountain"](https://www.santafetrailnm.org/site29.html), and the smaller mountain is called "Rabbit Ear Butte" due to the steep sides’ and characteristic flat top [^ExploringExpedition].
